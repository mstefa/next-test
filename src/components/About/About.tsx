            Before joining the world of tech, I studied and worked as an aeronautical engineer. I first fell in love with coding
            in high school where we developed some simpleâ€™s apps on Visual Basic ðŸ¤”.
            In college, I always went around developing software for mechanics and aerodynamics calculus, as I did on
            my <a href='https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7585325' target="blank">thesis</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            After working in some of first line companies as a Team Leader Engineer designing and maintaining mechanical assets,
            I decided to come back to codding and I joined the <a href='https://www.soyhenry.com/' target="blank">Henry bootcamp</a>.
            Now I enjoy building a variety of digital experiences ðŸ˜„.

            As a full-stack developer, I care about producing software that is both, durable and useful.
            Here are a few technologies I&aposve been working with:
